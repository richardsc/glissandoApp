This app can be used to help score a glissando. The basic idea is that the glissando goes from the start note to the end note, in the desired number of beats, by emulating the constant movement of a finger along a string. The output of the calculation is displayed in the plot, which shows the progression of notes through time. 

The vertical lines indicate beats, with the solid lines showing 1/8th notes and the dashed lines showing 1/16th notes in between. The horizontal red lines indicate individual notes, as labeled on the right axis.

The circles show the times when the gliss passes through the frequency of specific notes. Because this doesn't always happen on a regular beat the app does some calculations to determine notes that are *close* to regular beats.

The axis along the top of the plot indicates notes that fall within a 1/32nd note of one of the 1/16th note beats, and thus could be used to score the glissando by referencing a specific note to a specific beat.
